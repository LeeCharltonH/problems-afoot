              <p>
                With extensive experience across both NHS and private settings,
                I have been practising podiatry for over 30 years.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since qualification I have undertaken postgraduate education in
                wound care and musculo-skeletal disorders. To complement his I
                have trained in shockwave therapy (ESWT) to relieve chronic
                disorders.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whilst in the NHS I was involved in high risk wound care working
                across hospitals, domiciliary and community settings.
              </p>
              <p>
                I enjoy making feet more comfortable. From an ingrown nail,
                through to crippling corns to tender tendons; Iâ€™m here to help!
